# Useful resources for a developer career path

A list of useful resources for developers as they progress through their careers.

Each topic has resource(s) listed as per what is the best-though opinionated-reading materials, related course, or corresponding video for each topic.

The resources listed here are language and technology-agnostic, except the database topic, where PostgreSQL is listed. Refer to https://roadmap.sh/ for a roadmap specific to your career path.

For more computer science topics, or if you are starting as a computer science graduate, I highly recommend referring to https://teachyourselfcs.com/. They have structured the content well, and most of the references are inspired by that site.

> Note: As with any software-related topic, some references may be debatable. This is to provide a good reference for use, may not be the best reference out there.

## Developer

If you are starting as a developer, it's very important to have a strong base to start your career. The resources listed below will help you develop that base.

Study all the topics below, in roughly the presented order, using either the suggested reading, video or course materials.

## Senior Developer

Once you have developed a strong base, it's time to develop your expertise. As a senior developer, you should be versed in topics under the `Developer` section and below resources will help you with developing the expertise.

As a senior developer, you are required to coach and train mentors. Soft skills also play a vital role for a senior developer, a corresponding reference is added for it.

## Tech Lead/Principal Engineer/Architect

As you gain more experience, having system design and system architecture knowledge becomes valuable. It's good to understand the basics of it so that you can find out common system patterns and design the system better.
